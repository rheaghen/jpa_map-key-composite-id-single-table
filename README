H2: 
currently setup to use a static/unchanging file based h2 database. You'll need to fire up an h2 console and run the schema.sql and data.sql files before running the tests
remember to disconnect from the console before starting the test. 
optional - 
   copy/replace the ./sql/h2/application.properties to the src/test/resources if youre switching from the postgres config
   if youre using ios/linux - be sure to update the h2 datasource url in the application.properties

POSTGRES:
either try the ./sql/postgres/POSTGRES_BAK.sql OR setup the tables manually and then execute the ./sql/postgres/schema.sql & ./sql/postgres/data.sql
also copy/replace the ./sql/postgres/application.properties to the src/test/resources
