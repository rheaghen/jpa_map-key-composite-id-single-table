This repository was built to serve as a working example of a way to use JPA to populate a map of entities using 1 table and 1 view (view serves onlt to distinctly select the categorizing portions of the tables primary composite keys.)

H2: 
currently setup to use a static/unchanging file based h2 database. 
optional - 
   copy/replace the ./sql/h2/application.properties to the src/test/resources if youre switching from the postgres config
   if youre using ios/linux - be sure to update the h2 datasource url in the application.properties

POSTGRES:
either try the ./sql/postgres/POSTGRES_BAK.sql OR setup the tables manually and then execute the ./sql/postgres/schema.sql & ./sql/postgres/data.sql
also copy/replace the ./sql/postgres/application.properties to the src/test/resources
